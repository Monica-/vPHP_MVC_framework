### vanilla PHP mini framework ###

One day I thought: how would I make a MVC app with vanilla PHP? It was fun thinking about how to systematize the changes and growth of an application.

This is only the foundation, a starting point to start easily an app without libraries. This makes it easier to modify or add new classes to adapt to different needs.

**With this framework, a URI is translated into a call of a method of a controller, with all the data from the URI ready to be used.**

This is the main point of this framework. How to organize the rest is just a suggestion.
